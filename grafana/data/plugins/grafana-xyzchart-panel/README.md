# XYZ Chart

![XYZ Chart Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/199847/223649214-e7ed1bc6-1b94-4223-96e6-a04b80c379e7.png)

The XYZ Chart can be used to plot three-dimensional (or higher dimensional) datasets. 3D plots are useful for a number of applications including geographic plotting, multivariate analysis, and more.


## Controls

The XYZ Chart includes typical 3D camera controls so that data can panned, zoomed, and rotated. This allows for straightforward analysis from various perspectives.

## Beta

This plugin is currently in beta. Many changes are expected so please pay attention to new versions being released.

## Implementation

The chart is built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) via the excellent [React 3 Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [React 3 Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei). The chart implements a (very) small 3D chart rendering library. We hope to extend this with more chart types in the future.
